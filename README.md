<h1>Hey There! 👋</h1>
I'm Kwame A, I’m a front-end developer with a strong interest in building clean, accessible, and user-focused interfaces. My background in Information Technology has given me a solid technical foundation, while my UX training helps me think beyond implementation and focus on how users actually experience products.
